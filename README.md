# ncorr_2D_matlab

This is the offical repo for:

```
Ncorr: open-source 2D digital image correlation matlab software
J Blaber, B Adair, A Antoniou
Experimental Mechanics 55 (6), 1105-1122
```

Please cite this paper if you use this software in your research. 

# Installation instructions

```
git clone https://github.com/justinblaber/ncorr_2D_matlab.git
```

Then, in MATLAB:

```
>> cd ncorr_2D_matlab
>> addpath(pwd);
>> handles_ncorr = ncorr;
```

If MEX is set up properly, the MEX files associated with the program *should* compile automagically and a GUI will appear. For more information, please visit the associated website at: [https://www.ncorr.com](https://www.ncorr.com)

For convienience, a direct link to the manual is available [here](http://www.ncorr.com/download/ncorrmanual_v1_2_2.pdf) and an instructional step-by-step youtube video is linked below:
